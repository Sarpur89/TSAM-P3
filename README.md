# TSAM Project 3

# Botnet

This program allows a user to connect a client program to a server program. 
The server then allows up to 5 other servers to connect to it and the client
is then able to send commands to those connected servers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Ubuntu or a Linux based OS.
Terminal.
Our project files.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

How to compile:
Step 1: Start by having the cpp files in an appropriate folder.
Step 2: Open the terminal and navigate to the folder in step 1.
Step 3: Run the following command: g++ nameOfFile.cpp -o executableName -std=c++11 (Do for both files)
Step 4: Run the server program.
Step 5: On another terminal, run the client program.
Step 6: Profit.

## Notes

We tried to implement what we could but the instructions were a bit vague. It was hard to get into the assignment
and it was a bit on the heavy side and it was hard to get help when you are really lost overall. We had another 
large assignment due for another class that was due on friday 26th October. That assignment was worth 20% of the 
final grade and a grade of 5 was needed to pass the course.

* We worked closely with group **V_GROUP-65**, Hinrik Helgason and Benedikt Þorri Þórarinsson.
